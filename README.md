# robot_redesign_and_assembly
assembled a robot, as part of a summer training task, where the head, body, base and screen were provided by Smart Methods company. Also redesigned few elements for enhancment for the original model. 

The enhancments:
 -Added a circular base on the original base that could pivot the robot's body to any direction, to add flexiblity to the model.
 -added some joint flexiblity to the robot's body.
